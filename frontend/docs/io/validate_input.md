# Input Validation

## Problem Statement

Validate if an input text or file representation conforms to the FASTA format, containing only allowed IUPAC genetic bases ($A$, $T$, $G$, $C$, $N$ case-insensitively) in sequence lines.

## Overview

Before parsing or executing operations on genomic files, we must validate their formatting. In FASTA files, lines starting with `>` are descriptive headers and are skipped during base validation. Other non-empty lines must only contain valid nucleotide characters.

## Method

1. Define a reference set of valid characters: $A$, $T$, $G$, $C$, $N$ (both upper and lower case).
2. For each line in the input data:
   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace.
   - If the line starts with `>` or is empty, skip validation for that line.
   - Otherwise, check if any character in the line is not in the reference set. If an invalid character is found, immediately return `False`.
3. If all checked lines are valid, return `True`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(N)$ where $N$ is the total number of characters in the input.
- **Space Complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(W)$ where $W$ is the maximum length of a single line, to perform character validation set difference lookups.
