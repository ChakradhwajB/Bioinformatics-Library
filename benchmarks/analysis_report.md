## Detailed Empirical Observations

### 1. Linear-Time ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) Operations & Python VM Optimizations

- **CPython native translation efficiency vs Python loop bytecode interpreter:**
  The operations `Complement`, `ReverseComplement`, and `Transcribe` are implemented using Python's built-in `str.translate` (using translation tables mapped via `str.maketrans`). This delegates character translation directly to the CPython virtual machine's underlying compiled C code.
  Consequently, at a sequence length of $100,000$:
  - `Transcribe` takes only **$386.8\mu\text{s}$**.
  - `ReverseComplement` takes **$896.9\mu\text{s}$**.
  - Contrastingly, `HammingDistance`, which runs in $\mathcal{O}(\min(n, m))$ time, requires a Python-level bytecode loop (`for char1, char2 in zip(...)`). Because of the Python interpreter's bytecode dispatch overhead, `HammingDistance` at $100,000$ takes **$6.425\text{ms}$** — roughly **15 times slower** than transcription.
- **String reconstruction overhead:**
  Reversing strings using Python's slice notation (`[::-1]`) is highly optimized. We see this in `ReverseComplement` ($896.9\mu\text{s}$) taking only slightly longer than a standard `Complement` translation.
- **Input Validation & Parsing overhead:**
  `ValidateInput` and `FastaParse` run in linear time but perform additional memory allocations. `ValidateInput` uses a character lookup check (`set(line) - bases`), running in $6.583\text{ms}$ at $100,000$ characters. `FastaParse` utilizes list append operations and joins them at the end, running in $634.8\mu\text{s}$ at $100,000$ characters.

### 2. Quadratic-Time ($\mathcal{O}(n \cdot m)$) Operations & Mathematical Proof

- **Linear vs Log-Log Scale Visuals:**
  - In the **Linear Scale Plot**, the execution curves of Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, and Smith-Waterman bend sharply upward. At $n=100$, execution completes in a few milliseconds. By $n=5,000$, execution runtimes jump to **$22.46\text{s}$** (Levenshtein), **$27.62\text{s}$** (Needleman-Wunsch), and **$25.77\text{s}$** (Smith-Waterman).
  - In the **Log-Log Scale Plot**, the quadratic curves transform into straight lines.
- **Empirical Slope Calculation:**
  Let's calculate the slope ($m$) of the Smith-Waterman runtime line:
  $$T(n) = C \cdot n^m \implies \log_{10}(T(n)) = m \log_{10}(n) + \log_{10}(C)$$
  Using empirical data points for Smith-Waterman:
  - At $n_1 = 100$, $T(n_1) = 4.572\text{ms} = 4.572 \times 10^{-3}\text{s}$
  - At $n_2 = 5,000$, $T(n_2) = 25.776\text{s}$

  Calculating the slope:
  $$m = \frac{\log_{10}(T(n_2)) - \log_{10}(T(n_1))}{\log_{10}(n_2) - \log_{10}(n_1)} = \frac{\log_{10}(25.776) - \log_{10}(0.004572)}{\log_{10}(5,000) - \log_{10}(100)}$$
  $$m = \frac{1.4112 - (-2.3399)}{3.6989 - 2.0} = \frac{3.7511}{1.6989} \approx 2.21$$
  The calculated slope is extremely close to $2$, mathematically confirming the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time complexity.

## Technical Concerns & Limits

### 1. Python Interpreter Overhead (CPU Bound)

Pure Python loops are slow for heavy computations. At $n = m = 5,000$:

- The nested loop executes $5,000 \times 5,000 = 25,000,000$ iterations.
- Inside each iteration, the Python interpreter performs lookup lookups, conditional math checks, and heap objects generation.
- Running $25$ million iterations in Python takes $\approx 25$ seconds, whereas compiled code (C/C++ or Rust) would execute these operations in $<100\text{ms}$.

### 2. Memory Consumption (OOM Risks)

- Storing an $(n+1) \times (m+1)$ dynamic programming grid requires significant space.
- At $n = m = 5,000$, the score matrix contains $25,010,001$ cells.
- In Python, integers are heap-allocated objects, taking 28 bytes each. A list of lists representing a $5,000 \times 5,000$ grid occupies $\approx 700\text{MB}$ of RAM.
- If a user tries to align sequence lengths of $100,000$ bases, the grid will require $10^{10}$ cells, demanding **over 280 GB of memory**, leading to immediate out-of-memory (OOM) crashes.

## Methodological Improvements

To resolve these performance bottlenecks, the following enhancements should be implemented:

### 1. Hirschberg's Algorithm (Linear-Space Alignment)

Implement **Hirschberg's Algorithm**, which combines Needleman-Wunsch with a divide-and-conquer strategy:

- Space complexity is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot m)$ to **$\mathcal{O}(\min(n, m))$**.
- It only keeps two rows of the DP matrix in memory at any time to compute the forward and backward scores.
- This completely eliminates the memory bottleneck, allowing alignment of sequences up to $100,000$ bases on standard hardware.

### 2. Native Compilation (Numba / Rust extensions)

Compile the dynamic programming nested loops:

- **Numba JIT**: Apply Numba's `@njit` decorator to compile the loops into native machine instructions at runtime.
- **Rust Integration (PyO3)**: Re-write the core alignment loops in Rust. This achieves C-like execution speed while maintaining a clean Python interface.
- Expected speedup: **100x to 150x**, reducing the $5,000 \times 5,000$ alignment time from $25$ seconds to less than $200\text{ms}$.

### 3. Heuristic Alignment (BLAST-like Seed-and-Extend)

For large sequences, bypass the full DP matrix using seed-and-extend heuristics:

1. Locate short exact matches (k-mer seeds) using a hash table.
2. Extend these seeds locally using Smith-Waterman alignment.
   This reduces the average search time from quadratic to near-linear.
